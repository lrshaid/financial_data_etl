Optimizations we can apply to this exercise code:
1-Parallel ingestion may be applied to the ingestion script, since the data we are using and the hypertable have the same time dimension, would speed up the process 
and leverage the hardware in the best way possible.
2-Depending the operations, we can enable the chukwise aggregation/vectorized aggregation speeding up the query results such as sums.
3-Ensure the data per node is enable so a single node have chunks of the same hypertable optimizing the query time.
